I worked with Cameron on a tailored rehabilitation program for my leg, after a fall whilst running, and the results have been outstanding. Their evidence based approach and attention to detail made a significant difference in my recovery. The exercises were well structured, easy to follow, and adapted to my specific needs. My leg feels much better, and I’ve gained both strength and confidence in my movement. I highly recommend CARE Therapy for anyone seeking professional, personalized rehabilitative care',

Within weeks, I noticed significant improvements and recently started to run more freely with less pain. His insights into running form and strength training have been invaluable. I highly recommend him to anyone looking to improve their performance or return from injury.",

Since starting our Adapted Exercise sessions, my balance and walking have improved so much that I now only use my cane occasionally. I feel stronger, more stable, and more confident moving throughout my day. I’m also sleeping better, feeling more positive, and experiencing far less pain.',
